				<p style="margin-left:calc(5%)">The development of contemporary China, whether in terms of economy or people's living standards, 
					has made certain achievements. What will China's future development be?
					<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;China's development in the future can be divided into several directions:</p>
				<br><br>
				<p style="width:650px;margin-left: calc(10%)">
					&emsp;&emsp;<span style="text-align:center;font:25px Microsoft Yahei;color: #052545">
						Readjusting the economic structure.</span>
					<br>&emsp;&emsp;This is the main line of economic development for a long time to come.

Through the adjustment of economic structure, China's economic development to a new level,

And not just a low expansion of total GDP. Industrial structure adjustment is the main content of current economic structure adjustment.

The imbalance of technological and economic development in China requires attention to deal with two relations in the adjustment of industrial structure:

One is the relationship between the development of emerging industries and the transformation of traditional industries with new technologies.

First, the relationship between developing capital and technology intensive industries and developing labor intensive industries. Readjusting the economic structure.</p>

					二、Speed up the process of urbanization.</span>
				<br>
				<br>Recent problems in rural economic development,

There are also longer-term issues. There have been two basic situations since the 1990s:
				<br>&emsp;&emsp;First, the average annual growth rate of grain output is significantly higher than that of population.
				<br>&emsp;&emsp;Second, the per capita grain ration consumption of urban and rural residents declined. This has led to a considerable
				number of difficulties in the sale of agricultural products that have not been seen in the past.
				<br><br><br></p>
			<p style="width:900px;margin-left: calc(10%);color:#e9fffb">&emsp;&emsp;Now many agricultural products are higher than the international market price,
				it is difficult to raise agricultural prices to increase farmers' income.
				China's agricultural yield per unit area is not low, and the fundamental reason why it is not profitable to grow grain is that there are too many people and too few land to achieve scale operation.

It is difficult to enrich the peasants by farming alone. There is a lot of surplus labor in the countryside, and the characteristics of agricultural seasonality,

Many places are "one month, three months farming, eight months gambling". Township enterprises are an important source of income for farmers.

Non-agricultural income accounts for an increasing proportion of farmers' income, but many township enterprises are faced with overproduction and difficulties in sales.

The low-level scale expansion in the initial stage can no longer adapt to the change of market demand, and the structural adjustment and technological progress should include township enterprises.


				<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the long run, the fundamental solution to the rural problem lies in industrialization and urbanization, and the transfer of large amounts of agricultural population to non-agricultural industries.

It can be said that the most difficult point of China's industrialization and modernization is not in the cities, but in the vast rural areas.

China's industrialization and modernization started in cities and ended in rural areas. This is the most difficult task in China's modernization process.

Advancing urbanization is a fundamental issue in China's economic development in the 21st century.

				<span style="text-align:center;font:25px Microsoft Yahei;color: #c3c8cd">
					evelopment of the western region.</span>
				<br>&emsp;&emsp;The imbalance of regional economic development is a universal law. In China's thousands of years of history, regional development has been unbalanced.

In both the east and the west, the gap between cities and counties within the provinces and autonomous regions is widening.

Regional economic policy should emphasize two big picture. To implement the western development strategy is not to relax or slow down the development of the eastern region.

The development of the eastern region was, and will remain, for a long time to come, an extremely important force in financial, material and technological support of the overall national economy.

It is also a condition for supporting the development of the western region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions.

It is also a big picture to implement the strategy of western development and achieve coordinated development and common prosperity in the region.

				<span style="text-align:center;font:25px Microsoft Yahei;color: #c3c8cd">
					Fourth, achieve sustainable development.</span>
				<br>&emsp;&emsp;This is a worldwide issue. In the new stage of development, sustainable development should be highlighted.

We should pay attention to population and environmental problems. Population problem is a special problem in China's economic development. Population issue used to be two sentences: control the number of people,

Improve the quality of the population. A word should be added now: pay attention to the aging problem. Our country now 60 years old above population accounts for 10%.

Under the condition of small population base and developed economy, western countries have experienced aging after a long period of development, and they still encounter many problems.

Under the conditions of underdeveloped economy and a large population base, China has even greater difficulties in entering an aging society in a very short period of time.

The aging of population will bring about the problem of "the number of people who live and the number of people who eat".  </p>

					Improve the market economy.
				</span>
				<br>&emsp;&emsp;Now it's just "preliminary" to a market economy, that is, with a prototype, a big framework,

There are still many deficiencies and imperfections. We still need to emphasize institutional innovation and provide institutional guarantee for economic development through deepening reform.

China's accession to the WTO marks that China's economic restructuring has entered a new stage of development.

The stage of relatively perfect socialist market economy system. Institutional innovation is an indispensable part of China's modernization drive.

				<span style="text-align:center;font:25px Microsoft Yahei;color: #f0f0af">
					Developing an open economy.</span>
				<br>&emsp;&emsp;China's international economic environment and foreign economic relations have undergone profound changes.

It is mainly economic globalization and the expansion of China's opening to the outside world. Economic globalization is a trend.

Interwoven with the complex interests of various countries and fierce competition, it is inevitable to go through many twists and turns.

The consequences can be both positive and negative. Further integration into the process of economic globalization is a condition for realizing modernization,

However, China is backward in economy and technology and faces great pressure in the competition with developed countries. The key is to improve the competitiveness of China's economy

				<span style="text-align:center;font:25px Microsoft Yahei;color: #123f6c">Improve people's living standards.</span>
				<br>&emsp;&emsp;We should properly handle the relationship between national construction and people's livelihood and between accumulation and consumption.

We should give consideration to both national interests and people's livelihood. In social policy, we should pay attention to adjusting social distribution and solving the problem of employment.

Our country is facing heavy employment pressure. Over the next five years, 40 million new jobs will be created in urban areas and 40 million new agricultural workers will be transferred to non-agricultural industries.

That would still leave more than 12 million urban unemployed and more than 100 million rural surplus workers.

Actively expanding employment is a basic policy that needs to be adhered to for a long time. The shortage of goods in China is over.

Without the increase in urban and rural incomes and the increase in consumption levels, it is impossible to expand the domestic market and sustain economic growth.
